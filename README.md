# **xv6 projects**

We introduce to you three projects to the Unix version 6 operating system:

### 1. xv6 Lottery Scheduler
### 2. xv6 Virtual Memory
### 3. xv6 Kernel Threads 

<br/>

## Getting Started with xv6:

Use git to clone the xv6 repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public
```
Now go inside the xv6-public:
```
$ cd xv6-public
```
Install qemu emulator:
```
$ sudo apt-get install qemu
```
Then run the xv6:
```
$ make clean
$ make
$ make qemu-nox
```
To quit qemu emulation, type ctrl + a then x (that is, hold down control and while doing so, press a, then let go of control, then press x).

Now let's discuss projects details
<br/>

  ## 1. xv6 Lottery Scheduler

**Operating System XV6 (Unix version 6)**

This is our Operating systems course project we were assigned by our lecturer to modify UNIX version 6 to get a better sense of how an operating system works, We do implement a few projects inside a real OS kernel.

**Modifications we made to the system:**

- a lottery scheduler, The basic idea is simple: assign each running process a slice of the processor-based in proportion to the number of tickets it has; the more tickets a process has, the more it runs. Each time slice, a randomized lottery determines the winner of the lottery; that winning process is the one that runs for that time slice.

1. Add support for tracking the number of “tickets” in a process:
      adding a system call called `settickets` which sets the number of “tickets” for a 
      process with the following prototype: `int settickets(int number).` By default, 
      processes should have 1 tickets.

2. Add a system call called `getpinfo `with the following prototype 
  `int getpinfo (struct pstat *);` where pstate defined as:
   `struct pstate {
        int num_processes;
        int pids[NPROC];       
        int ticks[NPROC];      
        int tickets[NPROC];   
    }; `

- setting `num_processes `to the total number of non-UNUSED processes in the process table
- for each i from 0 to num_processes, setting:
  `pids[i]` to the pid of ith non-UNUSED process in the process table;
  `ticks[i]` to the number of times this proces has been scheduled since it was created;
  `tickets[i]` to the number of tickets assigned to each process.

- Add support for a lottery scheduler to xv6, by:
  changing the scheduler in `proc.c` to use the number of tickets to randomly 
  choose a process to run based on the number of tickets it is assigned;

- `int getpinfo(struct pstat *).`This routine returns some information about all running processes, including how many times each has been chosen to run and the process ID of each.

 ## 2. xv6 Virtual Memory
 
### Null pointer dereference
 The main problem here is that in xv6, the VM system uses a simple two-level page table as discussed in class. As it currently is structured, user code is loaded into the very first part of the address space. Thus, if you dereference a null pointer, you will not see an exception (as you might expect); rather, you will see whatever code is the first bit of code in the program that is running.<br/>
	So the solution is to shift the paging by one page so when a program is been loaded in the memory, it loaded into the memory from the second page not from the address zero , when null pointer is defined it will try to access an invalid address so the program will trap and get error and then the process will be killed .
	
### Read only code
The main problem here is that in xv6 code is marked as readable and writeable so any program can overwrite its code so we need to change the protection bits of some pages of the page table to make it read only and we should to return it back to its original state<br/>
To do this we need to make two system calls : <br/>
    1) First one is int mprotect (void *addr, int len) to change the protection bits of the pages from that 
       addr up to that addr plus that len to be read only    <br/>
    2) Second one is int munprotect (void *addr, int len) to change the protection bits of the pages 
       from that addr up to that addr plus that len to be readable and writeable

 ## 3. xv6 Kernel Threads
### Project requirements:
In this project, you'll be adding kernel threads support to xv6, to achieve this we must do the following implementations:

**1-** Implement `clone()` system call should look like this: `int clone(void(*fcn)(void *), void *arg, void *stack)` to create a new kernel thread which shares the calling process's address space, the new thread also uses stack as its parent stack. The stack should be one page in size and page-aligned. The new thread starts executing at the address specified by fcn. As with fork(). It It returns the thread PID to the parent and 0 to the child (if successful), -1 otherwise.

**2-** Implement join() system call should look like this: `int join(void **stack)` to wait for a child thread that shares the address space with the calling process to exit then kill it.

**3-** Implement a simple turn lock to support multi-threaded programs. There should be a type turnlock that one used to declare a lock, and three routines: `void init_lock(turnlock *)`, `void acquire_lock(turnlock *tlock)`, and `void release_lock(turnlock *tlock)` which initialize, acquire and release the lock. The turn lock should use the xchg atomic add to avoid concurrency bugs.

**4-** Build a little thread library to be on top of these raw system calls, with a create_thread(), join_thread(), init_lock(), acquire_lock(), and release_lock() functions to provide abstraction to user.
